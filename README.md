We had an amazing time on our website, where users enjoyed playing Pong together. We crafted a sleek user interface, introduced a chat feature, and hosted real-time multiplayer online games! Our journey followed these guidelines:

- Our backend was crafted with NestJS, ensuring a solid foundation.
- For the frontend, we embraced a TypeScript framework, adding our touch of creativity.
- Embracing libraries of our choice, we made sure to stay current with the latest stable versions.
- PostgreSQL became our database of choice; simplicity and efficiency in one.
- Our website, a dynamic single-page application, allowed users to navigate seamlessly with the Back and Forward buttons.
- Compatibility was key, ensuring a smooth experience on the latest versions of Google Chrome and another browser of our choice.
- The user's journey was error-free and warning-free, creating a hassle-free browsing experience.
- Launching everything with a single call: docker-compose up --build.

In addition, we delved into creating a vibrant chat experience:

- Users could create public, private, or password-protected chat rooms, shaping their interaction.
- Direct messages flowed effortlessly between users, fostering connections.
- Users had the power to block others, tailoring their chat experience.
- Channel creators automatically became owners, with the ability to set passwords and manage access.
- Channel owners, also administrators, had the authority to appoint other administrators.
- Administrators could manage user interactions within the channel.
- Playing Pong and connecting took a new turn with the ability to invite others through the chat interface.
- Exploring other players' profiles became a seamless part of the chat experience.
